## How can I contribute?

If you want to contribute, please follow the following steps.

### Create an issue

If you want to create an issue, please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/AdriBoy21/klassenapp-ios/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please use our templates to create an issue.

### Modifying the app

You will need an Apple Computer and the latest Version of [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) to modify the app. Experiences with Swift would be helpful.

#### Installation
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local computer. (e.g. with GitHub Desktop)
3. If not already done, install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) over the terminal. (= type in "sudo gem install cocoapods" in the terminal window). If you are not sure if CocoaPods is installed on your computer, type in "pod" or "pod --version" into the terminal window. "pod" should show you a list with commands and "pod --version" should output a version number.
4. Open the Terminal and go to the cloned folder. (cd [PATH TO FOLDER])
* Run "pod install" to install all libraries.
5. If finished, open the following file inside the cloned folder: "KlassenAppD.xcworkspace" (DO NOT USE THE "KlassenAppD.xcodeproj"!)

#### Uploading
1. Push the finished product to your forked repository.
2. Create a pull request:
* Go to [our repository](https://github.com/AdriBoy21/klassenapp-ios).
* Click on "New pull request".
* Click on "compare across forks".
* On the left dropdown menu, select our repository.
* On the right dropdown menu, select your forked repository.
